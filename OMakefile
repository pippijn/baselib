Package-Description[] =
  Common library for OCaml projects
  This library contains some common modules I use for
  most of my projects.
  Corelib does not use any system resources and native code,
  making it usable in js_of_ocaml. Baselib builds on top of
  it, adding some modules depending on native code or system
  resources.
